Why learn testing with Jasmine?
    Everyone makes mistakes

Unit testing
    test parts of a code

Use a framework to write tests
    Jasmine is a unit testing framework

Essential Keywords
    describe - "let me describe ___ to you."
    it - "let me tell you about __"
    expect - "here's what I expect"

Example using Earth
    describe("Earth");
    it("is round");
        expect(earth.isRound.toBe(true));
    it("is the third planet from the sun");
        expect(earth.numberFromSun).toBe(3)

matchers are what we expect output to be 

Matchers
    toBe/not.toBe does(compares references)
    toBeCloseTo
    toBeDefined
    toBeFalsey/toBeTruthy
    toBeGreaterThan/toBeLessThan
    toContain
    toEqual (compares values)
    jasmine.any() 

BeforeEach
run before each "it" callback 

Jasmine does not require addition

Spies
    *) Jasmine has test double functions called spies.
    *) A spy can mimic any function and track calls to it 
    and all arguments
    *) Spies only exists in the describe or it block in which
        it is defined 
    *) Spies are removed after each spec 
    *) There are special matchers for interacting with spies
