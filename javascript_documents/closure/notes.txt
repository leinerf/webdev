When is closure useful?

Private Variables
    helps make variables private like in other languages

Closures:
    closures exists when an inner function makes use of 
    variables declared in an outer function which has previously 
    returned 

    closure does not exist if you do not return an inner 
    function and if that inner function does not make use of 
    variables returned by an outer function 

    javascript will only remember values that are being 
    used inside of the inner function, not all variables defined
    in the outer function 

    closure isolates data and make variables private
